# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-11
- The project renamed to **magnetgate** (formerly oflx-poc); wire prefixes `oflx-*` → `mgt-*`,
  env `OFLX_*` → `MAGNETGATE_*`.
- M4: SOCKS5 (RFC 1928, no-auth, CONNECT, domains/IPv4) + split tunneling by rules
  (`MAGNETGATE_RULES`), remote DNS at the exit.
- Keep-alive (SO_KEEPALIVE 15 s) on both sides of the data channel; upstream timeout.
- Offer republished every 5 min; the client freshness window is 12 min (> the interval).
- A self-hosted DHT bootstrap on the VPS (public bootstraps are filtered on some networks).
- Persistent `seq` (`MAGNETGATE_SEQ_FILE`) — the BEP 44 CAS requirement across restarts.
- Fixes: `verify` is mandatory for BEP 44 in bittorrent-dht; the sodium-native argument order of
  `crypto_sign_verify_detached`; the salt in `dht.get()` opts.
- Tests: M1–M4 pass (see tests/results.md); HTTPS to a blocked resource through the tunnel — 200.
- Documentation is now English-primary with Russian versions in `docs/ru/` and `README.ru.md`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-11
- First PoC (oflx-poc): BEP 44 signaling + a TCP data channel + a fixed-target forwarder.
  The local loop and the public DHT verified.
